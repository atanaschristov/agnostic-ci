### TODO

Things to do:

- Introduce the concept of root contexts
- rethink, simplify and refactor the context managers so they have a unified way of processing the commands
- rethink the way command results are exposed, making sure there is a unified way of handling the commands output
- rethink simplify and reorganize the localization of the custom external commands. Currently partially implemented.

Things to consider:

- reorganize the code into monorepo
